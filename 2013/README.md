# THREADS 2013: DARPA Cyber Fast Track

In 2011, DARPA launched Cyber Fast Track and led a revolution in government-funded cybersecurity research. For the first time, individual hackers could pitch their own great ideas and, if selected, receive government funding for their projects immediately. For 18 months, DARPA came to agreements with over 100 commercial firms to fund cutting-edge advancements in information security that have now made their way into open-source and commercial products. This yearâ€™s THREADS conference highlights some of the best tools, products and research to come out of the Cyber Fast Track program and gives you the opportunity to hear from the researchers themselves.
